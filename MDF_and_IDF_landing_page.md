Purpose
This document defines the standards for the equipment that is deployed and maintained within the MDF and IDF spaces, as well as specifications for the room itself. This documentation is to be used when deploying a new space, or when remediating existing spaces to ensure they adhere to our current standards.
Components
All components and standards that are referenced here contain the specifications, rack positioning, labelling, and support processes. For brokered standards, our relationships with the leadership and Subject Matter Experts (SME) of our partners allow us to ensure the documentation for the equipment we deploy and provide access that contains the same elements as those owned by Workplace Technology.
Access
This section defines who will use this documentation for deployment, support, or reference. This aims to provide access that each team will need to the critical components and documentation required to perform their role.

Workplace Technology Brokered Standards
Brokerred standards are standards from IT partners that require technology to be installed within Red Hat office locations. Any technology installed within our offices goes through a vetting process that considers security, bandwidth, support, stability, and interconnectability as primary factors. Workplace Technology provides engineering expertise to aid in equipment selection. They deploy this equipment and provide network and power connectivity, along with the essential configuration to allow the service owner to access their equipment for further configuration and maintenance needs.
IT-Network Brokered Standard
IT-Network provides network switching and routing equipment, as well as wi-fi and network monitoring equipment to manage the health of the system.
Components Include
Network Equipment
WAN Optimization Equipment
ISP and Circuit Equipment
Cable Types
Schematic Design
Network Monitoring Equipment
Out-Of-Band Connectivity Brokered Standard
Wireless Infrastructure Brokered Standard
MDF / IDF Network Monitor Probes - Brokered Standards
IT-UC&C Standard
IT-Communications handles the telephony requirements within Red Hat offices. This includes managing the SIP providers and any associated equipment needed to provide end-to-end connectivity. This service also supports the videoconferencing endpoints that provide dedicated conferencing within our global conference rooms and enclaves.
Components Include
Voice Gateways
Session Border Controllers (SBCs) Within Offices
POTS Lines for OOB Management (or other local dependencies)
Schematic Design
RingCentral and OpenUC Standards
IDS Standard
IT provides an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) within each Red Hat office. This requires equipment that can handle the volume of data traversing the links in and out of the offices. Workplace Technology provides engineering assistance in selecting hardware that can support these needs. They deploy this equipment into the MDF of each office.
Components Include
